# Spam Mail Prediction Project

## Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam or not. The model utilizes various features and algorithms to classify emails accurately.

## Project Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the email data to prepare it for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant features from the email content such as keywords, sender information, and email structure.
3. **Model Development:** Building machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks to predict spam emails.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Deployment:** Implementing the model in a production environment for real-time spam detection.

## Files Included:
- **data.csv:** Dataset containing email samples labeled as spam or non-spam.
- **preprocessing.py:** Python script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **feature_engineering.py:** Code for extracting features from emails.
- **model_training.py:** Script for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **prediction.py:** Application for predicting whether a new email is spam or not.

## Instructions:
1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed.
2. Run preprocessing.py to clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. Execute feature_engineering.py to extract relevant features.
4. Run model_training.py to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
5. Use prediction.py to classify new emails as spam or non-spam.
